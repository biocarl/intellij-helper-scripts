# IntelliJ Helper Scripts


## A loose collection of scripts which automate certain tasks in IntellJ

### [Script 1](scripts/ImportModule.ws.kts): Import single module from multi-module repository

- In order to make this work you need a `.iml` in each module (for multi-module repo you need to make sure that those are not on .gitignore)
- This is a Kotlin Worksheet Script - for running it you need to right-click on the file (not in the Playround-Play-Button)
